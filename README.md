# Imad Qureshi- Data Visualization Portfolio  
# About
Hi, I'm Imad. I earned my bachelor's in Information Decision Science, focusing on data analytics, from the University of Illinois at Chicago. I pioneered data analysis roles at both of my previous companies, laying the groundwork for effective data-driven decision-making. I excel at presenting complex data to senior leaders and simplifying technical jargon for non-technical audiences. My expertise extends to developing KPIs across various departments like Accounting, Marketing, HR, Sales, Ecommerce, Distribution, and Healthcare. I'm proficient in BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Google Data Studio, along with programming languages such as R and Python.

Throughout my studies, I sharpened my skills in handling intricate data sets and spotting patterns and trends. I gained hands-on experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which I believe are assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and methods, always eager to expand my knowledge and abilities. Whether collaborating with a team or working solo, I'm motivated by the excitement of uncovering insights and using data to tackle challenging problems.
